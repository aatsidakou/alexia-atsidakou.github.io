I am a fourth-year PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin, supervised by [Constantine Caramanis](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/people/faculty/constantine-caramanis) and [Sujay Sanghavi](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/people/faculty/sujay-sanghavi). My research interests include Online Machine Learning, Optimization, Multi-Armed-Bandits and Algorithms. During the past years I have focused on developing and analyzing Machine Learning methods tailored to practical applications of online nature. In addition to that, I am currently interested in Data-driven Statistical Inference and Multi-Agent Systems.

I spent the summer of 2022 at Amazon Science where I was mentored by [Branislav Kveton](https://bkveton.com/).
I received my BSE in 2019 from the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, of the National Technical University of Athens, Greece. During the same year, I worked as a research associate at the [National Center for Scientific Research](https://www.demokritos.gr/) in Greece.
